Akira is a hombrew application built with xfangfang's fork of [borealis](https://github.com/xfangfang/borealis) that utilises a forked variant of [chiaki-ng](https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng) on the Nintendo Switch.

## Maintainers

## Issues

Akira is a personal project developed for myself primarily as the main user. Please don't come in and treat me like your personal slave, because I'm getting very tired of debugging people's networks with almost no information at all other than "this doesnt work". If I had a crystal ball, I would use it to win the Euromillions.

I am present on chiaki-ng discord's switch-support channel, where StreetPea has graciously allowed me to seed akira amongst existing chiaki-ng users. 

I will not respond to direct pings, please try to use the search button and/or [read the docs](https://xlanor.github.io/akira) first and then post a message with details of what you've tried. 

I'd also love to hear if you're using this application and it works well for you.

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please help out and open a PR with the fix/implemented feature. 

## Features

- **Basic remote play over an external network.** Same caveats as chiaki-ng, PSPlay, PSPortal, and the rest: you have to punch through to PSN for initiation. 
- **Cloud Streaming**
- **Multiple PSN profiles**
- **Select bitrate.**
- **Hidden menu** (think unlocking developer settings on Android) to raise the bitrate cap to 30k. You *request* a bitrate. The PS5 may or may not give it to you. It's not constant-bitrate encoding.
- Gyro support and reset including the ability to pick which controller drives gyro (default left)
- After many nights debugging with kkwong, input latency is comparable with running android on your switch.
- Switch away from mbedTLS to libnx crypto
- Stream debug menu with stats
- Stream disconnection ability
- **Fully supported in-app wireguard.** (No tailscale support will be forthcoming, stop asking)
- **Fully Remappble input bindings**
- Ability to sleep the console on exit
- **FSR 1.0** with configurable filters
- Trophy page support
- Auto-registration over PSN, requires holepunching.
- Cross-subnet discovery (swept by unicast)
- AIA chain repair (when encountering a PSN node with only leaf TLS certs)
